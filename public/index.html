          Greetings Fellow Rubyists!
        </dt>
        <dd>
          <p>My name is Daniel M Martin, my friends call me
            Dan. I live in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, where I have
            spent a good portion of my life.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt>

          Occupation
        </dt>
        <dd>

          <p>I am a medical doctor, practicing
          hospital care at a local community hospital.</p> 
          <p>Sometimes called a "hospitalist" or 
          HMO (House Medical Officer, which is not completely accurate),
          my current job is to look after the medical needs of 
          patients on an orthopedic ward.</p> 
          
          </dd>

        <dt>

          Computer Programming
        </dt>
        <dd>
 
         <p>I started taking computer science in high school in the 1970s,
         programming on punch cards which were physically taken
         to a university mainframe in a different part of the city.
         Later, we switched to a different government mainframe with
         a punch card / modem hookup.</p>

         <p>I was hooked, and continued to program in my spare time.
         There was not a lot of spare time in medical school nor in clinical practice.
         While in residency, I took out a loan to buy my first computer, a Commodore&nbsp;64.</p>

         <p>In the late 1990s I worked as an assistant in vascular surgery and attended
         the University of Manitoba taking Computer Science.
         I finally took a year off from work to complete my degree, 
         an (Honours) Bachelor of Computer Science.</p>
         
         <p>In 2000 I started work as a hospitalist, 
         which meant I was extremely busy during my rotations but then had blocks of time off.
         From 2000 to 2007 I worked on my MSc.
         It took a long time, scheduling courses between rotations.  
         I finally settled on a thesis topic, 
         involving taking arithmetic methods of CT reconstruction and running them in parallel
         on a simulated CT scanner.</p>
         
         <p>Since then I have dabbled, writing programs for my own use 
         including a medical billings program.</p>
         
         <p>Some day I would like to write a program and acutually get paid for it.</p>
         
         </dd>
         
         

        <dt>
          Ruby
        </dt>
        <dd>
          <p>I learned to program in Waterloo Fortran, 
          and it was easy to learn Basic for my C64. 
          In university I was taught Pascal, 
          and exposed to Lisp, Algol, and Java.
          I taught myself C and C++ and used C++ for many years.
          I am currently learning Objective&nbsp;C and Cocoa on my Mac.
          I used Perl to write part of my billings program, 
          then, a couple years ago, stumbled upon Ruby.
          </p> 
          
          <p>I was looking for something to do web programming and of course 
          found many references to Rails.  
          I never did get Rails working for me, 
          but I was enthralled by the expressiveness and sheer beauty of Ruby.
          I now use Ruby for <i>almost</i> everything.  
          </p>

          Course: Programming for the Web with Ruby
        </dt>
        <dd>

          <p>After my next work rotation I will be taking the course 
          <a class="offsite"
            href="http://rubylearning.org/class/course/view.php?id=81">
          Programming for the Web with Ruby</a>, 
          presented by Satish Talim.
          </p>

          <p>I hope to learn about presenting dynamic web pages using Ruby,
          and also how to use web-like interfaces in other Ruby applications.</p> </dd>
